## 18/06/2018 - exam that should be similar to this
especially expression similar to exam
thursday's exam hopefully should be easier

the second part of the question from "Possible clashes..." is very weirdly formulated, the person who wrote this doesn't teach in the course anymore, our exam should be clearer. At the end it says that clashes (in the form `a[a[1]]`) are actually not possible, so let's ignore them.
careful: in the second example it uses a different variable for accessing the array (uses `x` instead of `i`) so basically we only check `a[x]` where x doesn't iterate as it's always fixed.

## other exam
next exam requested by some student, quite hard. If you can do this, for sure you're ready for the exam.
